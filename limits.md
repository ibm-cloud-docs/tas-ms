# Limitations and Exclusions
{: #limitations}

Overview of what is excluded from the Managed Services
TRIRIGA Application Suite Managed Services - Limitations and Exclusions

TRIRIGA Application Suite Managed Services is implemented using a defined set of technologies and operates within a security profile designed to ensure our  client's data is secure and the applications operate efficiently and effectively.  As a result of the decisions made regarding technologies and to meet the high security standards, there are differences between what is available using the Managed Services and what a client could do if they hosted and operated the Suite themselves.
 
The following items are not included or allowed in the TRIRIGA Application Suite Managed Services offering:
 
## Databases
{: #limitations-db}
 
Only DB2 is supported.  Oracle and SQLServer are not supported.  Conversion services are available.
 
## 3rd Party Applications
{: #limitations-3rd}
 
TRIRIGA Application Suite Managed Services will not host or support any 3rd party application.  3rd Party applications hosted outside the MS environment can be integrated to applications with the Suite provided they follow standard integration protocols.
 
## Access
{: #limitations-access}
 
Clients will not have access to the operating system, file system or overall administration of the Suite.  DBAdmin access or direct updating of the database is not allowed.
 
## TAS Administrator Functions
{: #limitations-adminf}
 
Direct access to the clusters is not available.  Changes required must be submitted using the ticketing system and then the SRE team will execute.
