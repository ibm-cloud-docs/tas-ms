## Abstract

Before submitting an order, the following should be considered to ensure the order is 'right sized' and will meet the requirements of the client.

Important:
Customers must purchase (or own) App Points for TRIRIGA Application Suite (TAS) prior to (or in conjunction with) ordering the IBM Managed Service. The managed service provides IBM Cloud based hosting, product installation, operation, maintenance and support for TAS.

Information should be gathered about the potential usage of the suite, including which applications will be required, how many users on each application and the primary usage of the applications.

There are three (3) TAS-MS part numbers:

D02QTZX - Capacity

D02QUZX - Data

D02QWZX - VPC (Virtual Processor Core)
