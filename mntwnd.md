It is expected customers will be upgraded to the current version within 6 months of release.  Upgrades will be deployed first to test and then scheduled for production.  The test window length will depend on the size and complexity of the change and will be communicated through the Customer Communications Center as soon as it is available.

## Emergency Maintenance:
{: #Emergency-Maintenance}
