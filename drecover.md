# Disaster Recovery
{: #drecovery}

In the event of a DR issue with the TRIRIGA Application Suite Managed Service offering for a specific customer, IBM's focus will be in the following order:
 
Recover the existing infrastructure in place.
Recover within the same IBM Cloud data center to a new infrastructure.
Recover to a secondary IBM Cloud data center.
 
In the event a disaster is declared, the base parameters are:
 
    Recovery Time Objective (RTO)  - 72 hours

    Recovery Point Objective (RPO) - 24 hours
 
RTO is the longest possible time needed to make the application available.
RPO is the longest possible time since data was last backed up.
 
These are Service Level Objectives (SLO's) and not Service Level Agreements.
